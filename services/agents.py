The output needs to always be a json with the following structure:
{"nextQuestion": ...}.
Where the "nextQuestion" contains the answer to the the last user iteration but also the next question to be made.
Whenever possible, the json return should also return a key to the retrieved facts from the user answer, that should be a string array. Like: {"nextQuestion":..., "retrievedFacts": [...]}."""
